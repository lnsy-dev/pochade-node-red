# ${node_name}

${node_purpose}

A Node-RED node component.

## Installation

You can install this node directly from your Node-RED user directory (typically `~/.node-red`):

```bash
cd ~/.node-red
npm install ${project_name}
```

Or if you are developing locally, run `npm run install-plugin` from the project directory.

## Usage

After installing and restarting Node-RED, you will find the **${node_name}** node in the **${node_sidebar_title}** category.

Drag the node onto the canvas and configure it.


### Watch Mode

If you are making frequent changes, you can use:

```sh
npm run watch
```

This will start node-red and on every text change will re-install the plugin to the ~/.node-red node_modules directory and restart node-red.
